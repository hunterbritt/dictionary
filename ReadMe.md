# 📚 Dev Dictionary
A simple dictionary app that allows users to search for the meaning of words. This app uses the [Dictionary API](https://www.dictionaryapi.dev/) to fetch the data.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 Search for the meaning of words
- 🔊 Pronunciation of words
- 📖 Examples of words
- 🔄 Synonyms of words
- ❌ Antonyms of words
- 📚 Sources of words

## 🛠️ Issues
I must say, I'm not a fan of the design of the app. The UI is a bit cluttered and the layout, but it's a good start.
